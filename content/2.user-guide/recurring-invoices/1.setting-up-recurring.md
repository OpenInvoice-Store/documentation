## Overview

Recurring invoices allow you to automate billing for regular customers. Set up a template once, and OpenInvoice will automatically generate invoices on schedule.

## Creating a Recurring Invoice Template

### Step 1: Navigate to Recurring Invoices

1. Go to **Recurring Invoices** in the main menu
2. Click **New Recurring Invoice**

### Step 2: Basic Information

Fill in template details:

- **Template Name** - Descriptive name for the template
- **Customer** - Select customer (or leave blank for multiple customers)
- **Currency** - Default currency
- **Invoice Template** - Select invoice template design

### Step 3: Schedule Configuration

Set up the billing schedule:

- **Frequency** - Choose from:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
  - Quarterly
  - Yearly
  - Custom (specify days)
- **Start Date** - When to start generating invoices
- **End Date** - Optional end date for time-limited subscriptions
- **Next Generation Date** - Automatically calculated

### Step 4: Add Line Items

Add products or services:

1. Click **Add Item**
2. Select from product catalog or enter custom item
3. Set quantity and price
4. Add tax information
5. Repeat for all items

### Step 5: Configure Settings

- **Usage-based Billing** - Enable usage tracking (optional)
- **Status** - Active or Paused
- **Notes** - Internal notes

### Step 6: Save Template

Click **Save** to create the template.

## Recurring Invoice Details Page

## Schedule Types

### Weekly

- Generates invoice every week
- Same day of week
- Example: Weekly retainer

### Monthly

- Generates invoice monthly
- Same day of month (or last day if day doesn't exist)
- Example: Monthly subscription

### Quarterly

- Generates invoice every 3 months
- Example: Quarterly service fees

### Yearly

- Generates invoice annually
- Example: Annual license fees

### Custom

## Usage-Based Billing

Enable usage-based billing for:

- Metered services
- Consumption-based pricing
- Variable billing amounts

### Setting Up Usage-Based Billing

1. Enable **Usage-based Billing** when creating template
2. Record usage data periodically
3. Invoices generated based on usage
4. Amount calculated automatically

### Recording Usage

1. Open the recurring invoice template
2. Go to **Usage** tab
3. Click **Record Usage**
4. Enter:
   - Usage period
   - Quantity/amount
   - Unit price (if different)
5. Save usage record

## Template Management

### Activating/Deactivating

- **Active** - Invoices will be generated automatically
- **Paused** - Generation paused, can resume later
- **Cancelled** - Template cancelled, no more invoices

### Editing Templates

1. Open the template
2. Click **Edit**
3. Make changes
4. Save

> **Note**: Changes affect future invoices, not existing ones.

### Duplicating Templates

Create similar templates quickly:

1. Open the template
2. Click **Duplicate**
3. Edit as needed
4. Save as new template

## Automatic Invoice Generation

### How It Works

- Cron job runs automatically (configured in settings)
- Checks for templates due for generation
- Creates invoices from templates
- Sends emails if auto-send enabled
- Updates next generation date

### Manual Generation

Generate invoices manually:

1. Open the template
2. Go to **Invoices** tab
3. Click **Generate Invoice**
4. Invoice is created immediately

## Generated Invoices

### Viewing Generated Invoices

1. Open the recurring invoice template
2. Go to **Invoices** tab
3. View all generated invoices:
   - Invoice number
   - Generation date
   - Amount
   - Status
   - Link to invoice

### Invoice Details

Generated invoices are regular invoices:
- Can be edited (with caution)
- Can be sent manually
- Can accept payments
- Track status normally

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Naming** - Use descriptive template names
2. **Test First** - Create test template before production
3. **Monitor Generation** - Check generated invoices regularly
4. **Update Items** - Keep line items current
5. **Set End Dates** - For time-limited subscriptions
