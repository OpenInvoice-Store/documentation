## Overview

Custom tax profiles allow you to manually configure tax rules for different jurisdictions. This is useful when TaxJar is not available or you need custom tax logic.

## Creating a Tax Profile

### Step 1: Navigate to Tax Profiles

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tax**
2. Click **Tax Profiles**
3. Click **New Tax Profile**

### Step 2: Basic Information

Fill in profile details:

- **Profile Name** - Descriptive name (e.g., "Canada - Ontario")
- **Country** - Select country
- **Region** - Select region/state/province
- **Description** - Optional description

### Step 3: Add Tax Rules

Add tax rules for this jurisdiction:

1. Click **Add Tax Rule**
2. Enter:
   - **Tax Name** - Name of tax (e.g., "GST", "PST", "VAT")
   - **Tax Rate** - Percentage (e.g., 5 for 5%)
   - **Authority Type** - Federal, State, Provincial, VAT, Local
3. Save rule

### Step 4: Add Multiple Rules

Add multiple tax rules if needed:

- **GST + PST** - Multiple taxes (Canada)
- **VAT + Local Tax** - Combined taxes (EU)
- **State + City Tax** - Multiple levels (US)

### Step 5: Save Profile

Click **Save** to create the tax profile.

## Tax Profile Presets

## Using Tax Profiles

### Setting Default Profile

Set default tax profile for organization:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tax**
2. Select **Default Tax Profile**
3. Save

Default profile is used when:
- No TaxJar calculation available

- Creating new invoices

### Applying to Invoices

Tax profiles can be applied:

- **Per Customer** - Set default profile for customer
- **Per Product** - Set tax profile for product

## Tax Rules

### Rule Types

- **Percentage-Based** - Percentage of subtotal
- **Fixed Amount** - Fixed tax amount
- **Compound** - Tax on tax (e.g., PST on GST)

### Authority Types

Categorize taxes by authority:

- **Federal** - Federal government tax
- **State** - State/province tax
- **Provincial** - Provincial tax
- **VAT** - Value-added tax
- **Local** - Local/municipal tax

## Tax Calculation

### How It Works

1. Select tax profile
2. Calculate tax for each rule
3. Sum all tax amounts
4. Add to invoice subtotal
5. Display tax breakdown

## Tax Exemptions

### Customer Tax Exemption

Set customers as tax-exempt:

4. Save

Tax-exempt customers:

## Best Practices
