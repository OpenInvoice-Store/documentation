## How TaxJar Works

### Automatic Calculation

When creating an invoice:

1. Customer address is provided
2. TaxJar calculates tax based on:
   - Customer location
   - Business location
   - Nexus regions
   - Product tax codes
3. Tax amount is calculated automatically
4. Added to invoice total

### Tax Calculation Priority

TaxJar is checked first in the tax calculation priority:

1. **TaxJar** (if enabled) - Automatic calculation
2. **Tax Overrides** - Manual tax rates
3. **Tax Profiles** - Custom tax rules
4. **Manual** - Item-level tax rates
