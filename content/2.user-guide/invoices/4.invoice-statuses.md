## Invoice Status Overview

Invoices in OpenInvoice progress through different statuses to track their lifecycle:

## Status Types

### Draft

**When**: Invoice is created but not yet sent

**Characteristics**:
- Can be edited freely
- Not visible to customers
- Not included in reports (unless filtered)
- Can be deleted

**Next Steps**: Send the invoice to move to "Sent" status

### Sent

**When**: Invoice has been sent to the customer

**Characteristics**:
- Visible to customer via shareable link
- Can still be edited (with caution)
- Included in "Outstanding" reports
- Email tracking available

**Next Steps**: 
- Customer pays → moves to "Paid" or "Partially Paid"
- Due date passes → moves to "Overdue"

### Paid

**When**: Invoice is fully paid

**Characteristics**:
- Payment amount equals invoice total
- Most fields are locked for editing
- Included in revenue reports
- Can generate payment receipt

**Next Steps**: Invoice is complete, no further action needed

### Partially Paid

**When**: Some payment received but not full amount

**Characteristics**:
- Payment amount less than invoice total
- Can accept additional payments
- Shows remaining balance
- Included in "Outstanding" reports

**Next Steps**: 
- Accept more payments → moves to "Paid" when fully paid
- Can still become "Overdue" if due date passes

### Overdue

**When**: Due date has passed and invoice is not paid

**Characteristics**:
- Past due date
- Not fully paid
- Highlighted in dashboard
- Triggers overdue reminders

**Next Steps**:
- Send payment reminder
- Accept payment → moves to "Paid" or "Partially Paid"
- Can be cancelled if payment not expected

### Cancelled

**When**: Invoice is cancelled (not expected to be paid)

**Characteristics**:
- No longer active
- Cannot be edited
- Not included in revenue calculations
- Can be filtered out of reports

**Next Steps**: Invoice is closed, no further action

## Status Transitions

### Automatic Status Updates

Statuses update automatically based on:

- **Payment Received** → Updates to "Paid" or "Partially Paid"
- **Due Date Passed** → Updates to "Overdue" (if not paid)
- **Full Payment** → Updates to "Paid"

### Manual Status Changes

You can manually change status:

1. Open the invoice
2. Click **Change Status**
3. Select new status
4. Add note (optional)
5. Confirm

> **Note**: Some transitions may require confirmation (e.g., cancelling a paid invoice)
